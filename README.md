# The Yoga Trap
Overview

I have spent the last three years building a brand centered around yoga and wellness under my name, Brittany L Hill and the event experience I created, Back Trap Yoga. My project focus will be on UI/UX which I'll apply to the app that I'm creating which will be a subscription-based yoga class platform, which allows a user to find videos of yoga classes of varying levels of difficulty and duration as well as yoga pose breakdown videos. I did some basic user research with my audience to gauge what things they were looking to see from me to fulfill their needs around yoga and wellness. Yoga class videos that could be accessed online were highly requested. This app will provide a platform that allow users to connect further by being able to experience my style of instruction anywhere they can connect to the app. The app will include yoga pose videos and gives students the opportunity to "take me anywhere" and get the key cueing they would receive if they were in person in class. The app allows them to maintain consistency in their practice while being able to explore poses at their own pace in the comfort of their own space.
